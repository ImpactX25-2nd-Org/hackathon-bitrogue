INSTRUCTIONS: Place Your Trained Model Files Here

This directory needs the following files for disease detection to work:

1. chilli_model_best.pth
2. groundnut_model_best.pth  
3. rice_model_best.pth

CLASS FILES (already created):
✓ chilli_classes.txt
✓ groundnut_classes.txt
✓ rice_classes.txt

MODEL TRAINING DETAILS:
- Architecture: EfficientNet-B3 with custom head
- Input: 224x224 RGB images
- Framework: PyTorch with timm library
- Training: Uses ImageNet pretrained weights

HOW TO ADD MODELS:

Option 1: Copy from training directory
If you have trained models, copy the .pth files:
```
copy path\to\chilli_model_best.pth backend\ml_models\
copy path\to\groundnut_model_best.pth backend\ml_models\
copy path\to\rice_model_best.pth backend\ml_models\
```

Option 2: Download from cloud storage
If models are stored in cloud (Google Drive, S3, etc):
1. Download the .pth files
2. Place them in this directory

Option 3: Use placeholder models (for testing)
To test the API without real models, create dummy files:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Create a dummy model with correct architecture
model = create_efficientnet_model(num_classes=6)
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'chilli_model_best.pth')
```

VERIFICATION:
After adding model files, the backend will show on startup:
- "✓ Loaded chilli model from ml_models/chilli_model_best.pth"
- "✓ Loaded groundnut model from ml_models/groundnut_model_best.pth"
- "✓ Loaded rice model from ml_models/rice_model_best.pth"

If models are missing, you'll see:
- "⚠️  Model file not found: ml_models/xxx_model_best.pth"
- API will return 503 error when trying to use that crop type

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Models not loading? Check file names match exactly
- Wrong predictions? Verify class names in .txt files match training
- CUDA errors? Models will automatically fall back to CPU
